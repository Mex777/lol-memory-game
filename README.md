# lol-memory-game

I created this game in order to learn how to work with hooks and React function components. I also used vanilla CSS to style the game.

In this game there are 10 cards with champions from the game League of Legends. Every time a user clicks on a card, the cards shuffle, if a user clicks on card which was already clicked the game ends.
The goal of the game is to click all the cards without clicking them multiple times.

The game is published at: https://mex777.github.io/lol-memory-game/ in case you want to play it. :)
